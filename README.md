## Introduction
The xMachineVue library combines concept of a state machine with a reactive store. By combining these two concepts, it allows you to manage your application’s state in a structured and predictable way. It provides you with the ability to define different states and transitions between them, while also allowing you to reactively track changes to your application’s state. This makes it easier to manage complex state logic in Vue.js applications.

### Installation
To use xMachineVue, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install xmachinevue
```
